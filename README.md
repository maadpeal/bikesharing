## Purpose

- A bicycle service dataset is studied to understand how it works and, based on this, replicate the business in another location.

## Results:

![]()

    - In this graph we can see that the time of greatest recurrence of bicycle use is approximately 5 minutes.


![]()

    - In this graph it can be seen that men are the ones who use the bicycle service the most, and they use it mostly for 9min

![]()

    - The hours that bicycles are used the most are those when going to and from work, usually at 8am and 5pm

![]()

    - It reinforces what we have been seeing in the other graphs, that it is used more than anything in the hours of going to and from work and that men are the ones who use the service the most.

![]()

    - We can see that those who use the service the most are male subscribers.

![]()

    - Although there is a large number of tourists that could generate some noise, in our analysis we can see that the station with the most users is the one that is close to the large central terminal.

![]()

    - As in the previous case, the station with the largest number of registered users is the one near the Great Central Terminal of New York.


## Summary

    - It is shown that men are the ones who make more use of the service, we could investigate why this is due, it could be because women more often wear clothes not suitable for riding a bicycle, which may be a possibility.

    - Although there are many tourists, I consider that the data is also quite valid because the hours that have the greatest number of users are the hours of entering or leaving work, which tells us that the users are people who live and work in the zones.


    - Another interesting fact is that most of the trips are less than 10 minutes and if we add that the stations where the trips start and end is at the train station, it tells us that they are people who come from outside or far from the center and use the service. of bicycles to complete routes.

    - It would be interesting to see the routes that are traveled the most in another graph, so it could tell us much more about the people who use the service, another graph that we could make is how the seasons of the year influence the use of the service.
